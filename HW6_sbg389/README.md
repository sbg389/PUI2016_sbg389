##Assignment I

### Can we measure and predict energy use based on observables that are easier to be acquired

This notebook presents an analysis on the energy consumption of manhattan buildings. The data used was sourced from the NYC open data site, and the main steps of the analysis were:

1. Adcquiring and transforming the data (Donwload and make a local copy of the pluto dataset, read the energy consuption dataset directly from the web, load all the date into padas dataframws)
2. Remove unnecesary columns, replace hard to manage column names, create a calculated column for total energy consumtion and find a common column to both dataframes.
4. Produce a series of plots to explore the data and present the relation between number of units and total energy consumption
5. Create linear models to predict both energy consumption based on number of units and viceversa.
6. Calculate the  chi-square values for the models in order to assess which one was better suited for the data.
7. Fit a 2nd order polynomial to the scatter plot.

Met and discussed the fitting, data cleanning, models and tests and refined the notebook togheter with Sofiya Elyukin, Luis Fernando Melchor Fernandez and Benjamin Joseph Alpert.

##Assignment II

### Citibike Authorea 

We created the article in Authorea for the Citibike mini project:
