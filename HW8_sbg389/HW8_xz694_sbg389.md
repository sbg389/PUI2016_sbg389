##### Plot representing the number of trips per hour of the day

## Review

### Clarity
The information presented by the plot is relatively easy to read; it doesn’t appear ambiguous, misleading or present distractions.

The plot presents a time series for a full day with hour intervals and the number of trips for each of these intervals. In this sense, the use of a continuous line might have been a better choice, giving a sense of continuity and making it easier to read it as a trend.

The plot does not make excessive use of graphical effects; it uses only two colors and presents a grid that makes it easy to relate the data points to the axis.

A possible improvement might be to clarify the nature of the trips (are these bike rides? Subway Rides?), and to remove the observation “peak at 8am and (…)” on the title, moving it to a more complete caption.

Another suggestion will be to remove some of the X and Y ticks to make the axis appear more clear (only one X axis label every three hours?).
 
### Aesthetic
The color selection is sober, but the use of red conveys certain urgency or criticality. The use of a color that brings less attention to the data points (such as a pale blue) might help seeing the plot as a whole 

### Honesty
No element on the plot appear to distort the reproduction of the data, but as commented on the previous point, the red color might be conveying a message that is not necessarily aligned with what the data represents.

### General Comments
Correct visualization, some comments related to the clarity and aesthetics. A caption with the summary of the story might be helpful to understand the general context and guide the user on the exploration of the data.
