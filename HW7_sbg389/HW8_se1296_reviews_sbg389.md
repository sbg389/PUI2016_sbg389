### Plot Clarity: 
   This plot is quite clear and easy to read. It would be beneficial however to add a caption which explains what the predictions and R^2 are, as well as which is better and why, particularly if someone without statistical knowledge were to look at the plot. 

### Plot Aesthetic:
   I think this plot is aesthetically pleasing and functional. The elements and chosen colors don't distract from each other and they communicate the information well. The only minor issue is overlap between the three elements around Year=1970, which can be easily fixed by adjusting the transparency of the curve. Additionally, just because the two regressions are labeled as predictions (and can easily be used for that purpose), it would have been nice to extend their x-range beyond 2016. This wouldn't be improving the plot though so much as just providing additional information and use.

### Plot Honesty:
   The plot presents the given data fairly honestly, but there is some distortion along the y-axis due to the usage of a logarithmic scale. Given the data used, it does make sense to manipulate the y-axis in some way for aesthetic purposes, but the plot would have been more honest if it stated that the y-axis was logarithmic. Alternatively, the GDP values could have been divided by 1000 for example and the y-axis labeled as "GDP in URY (thousands)".
