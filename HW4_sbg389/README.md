##Assignment II

This assignment looks at reviewing the chocices for satistical tests in schentiic literature. Two types of tests will be choosen from the  A. Marengo CSU "When to use what test?" document
(http://www.csun.edu/~amarenco/Fcs%20682/When%20to%20use%20what%20test.pdf)

I worked on this assignment with Sofiya Elyukin, each of us focused on one test and its corresponding journal artcile, shared the basic idea and refined it with each other.

###a. Selection of the tests.

I looked at the t-test:

The t-test looks at differences between two groups on some variable of interest, and the independet variable should have only two groups
E.G. (male/female, undergrad/grad): Do males and females differ in the amount of hours they spend shopping in a given month?

Sofiya looked at the path analysis for relationships between dependent and independent variables.

###b. Search for journal papers that uses the selected statistical tests )

The paper selected for the t-test analysis is "Does Cognitive Function Increase over Time in the Healthy Elderly?"

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078646

In this particular paper, the t-score is used to compare the independent variable "Mean cognitive test score" for different groups

Read the relevant portions of the paper (the abstract, and then a search for occurrences of the test name may be sufficient!) and identify what are the Dependent Variables (DV), Independent Variables (IV), and, if applicable, control variables (remember class 1 slides if you forgot), how many they are, and what type they are (categorical, continuous...).
