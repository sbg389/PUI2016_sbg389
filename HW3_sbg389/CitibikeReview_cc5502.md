##Assignment I: Peer Review of Citibike Assignment

* Author: Chongyang (Connor) Chen


Sebastian's hypothesis is very clear to me. His original idea is that there is higher usage of citibikes during rush hours on weekdays than during the same hours on weekends. He then use the ratio of rush hour trips to non-rush hour trips as the variable for the test. 

The null and alternative hypothesis statements are accurate based on the idea. 

Sebastian selected the right data columns and produced a clear picture to demonstrate the ratio of rush and non-rush hours in days of a week. 

There is a comparison between the values during weekdays and weekends. However, the amount of samples produced here is limited. It is still eligible for a t-test after calculating the standard error.
