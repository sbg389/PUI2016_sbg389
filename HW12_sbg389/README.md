## Assignment 1:  Jupyter notebook: SQL and Spatial Data Analysis

This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis of a dataset of hospital facilities Asthma dismissal records using CartoDB, SQL and geopandas. The notebook is based on the PUI 2016 Lab 12 notebook by fedhere. The main work on this notebook instance was:

1) To build the SQL query to retreive the aggregated dismissals by zipcode from CartoDB using the SQL API

2) To find and load a shapefile with the Manhattan zipcopdes, load it into a geodataframe and merge it with the data extracted from Carto

3) Create a semi-variogram based on the data

### Work Breakdown: 

The notebook instance is based on the provided reference notebook by FBB with coding by Sebastian Bania.

Aditional discussion and notebook adjustments done with Sofiya Elyukin, Jonathan D Geis, Luis Fernando Melchor Fernandez, Benjamin Joseph Alpert and Scott Smith
